# ğŸš€ PyVa - A Custom Hybrid Programming Language

Hello Everyone! ğŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m excited to introduce **PyVa**, a new **custom hybrid programming language** that combines the best of **Python** and **Java** â€” inspired by their simplicity and power.  
The name **PyVa** is derived by taking the first two letters from **Python** and the last two letters from **Java**.

## ğŸ’¡ Language Syntax Example

```pyva
def Hello(x: int, y: int) -> int:
  c = x + y;
  return c;

main {
  x = 10;
  y = 20;
  print(Hello(x, y));
}
